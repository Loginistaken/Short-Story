Title: “Un-Funny laugh and you're out”
A Dystopian 

Page 1 — The First Laugh

They said it started with a video.
Just a looping clip of a man slipping on a banana peel but slowed down in slow motion — then faster old-fashioned slapstick, the kind that used to make even the most sober smirk. The problem wasn’t the meme itself. It was the sound. A subtle, almost inaudible frequency baked into the file. Anyone who laughed — even chuckled — caught the “Joke.”

At first, it was harmless. People couldn’t stop laughing. The streets filled with hysterical sounds — uncontrollable, animal-like laughter echoing through subways and hospitals. Then, the laughter turned violent. The muscles convulsed, lungs collapsed, brains hemorrhaged. The virus wasn’t biological. It was neurological.
It spread through humor.

Albert Madsen didn’t find much funny these days.
He used have his P.H.D in comedy, focused as a writer — the kind of man who once made crowds roar on late-night TV. But he quit after the Incident. Now he worked as a behavioral linguist for the Federal NeuroDefense Corps — or what was left of it. His job: decode cognitive infections, linguistic pathogens, and “idea viruses.”
He was a specialist in memetic toxicity — weaponized thoughts.

So when the Joke spread, Albert was one of the few people immune. Not because he was special, but because his sense of humor was already dead.

The streets of D.C. had gone silent except for the occasional cackle drifting from an abandoned building.
Graffiti read:

“LAUGH OR DIE.”
“HAPPINESS IS CONTAGIOUS.”

Albert and his team — four soldiers and one data analyst named Mia — moved through the wreckage with respirators and neural filters. The devices scrambled auditory signals, preventing the virus from hijacking the brain’s humor centers.

They passed a group of bodies — mouths stretched wide, frozen in rigor-mortis laughter.

Albert muttered, “Un-funny.”

Mia glanced at him. “You always say that.”

“That’s because it always is.”

Mia was bright — too bright, Albert thought — still hopeful, still cracking dry jokes to survive the tension.
Gage, the squad leader, was military through and through — believed fear was weakness, believed laughter was death.
Torres and Vik, the twins, once DJs, now technicians who treated silence like religion.
And Albert, their reluctant prophet of irony, a man allergic to joy in a world where joy killed.

They were searching for the origin post — the first file uploaded before the networks crashed. Somewhere deep in the ruins, that meme still looped, endlessly broadcasting the Joke.

By the time they found the signal source — an old broadcast hub — the virus had changed.
No longer just sound.
Now it spread through irony, sarcasm, and intent.

Someone said something funny — even accidentally — and the virus triggered. It detected comedic structure, rhythm, or timing, then unleashed neural overload.

That night, around the campfire, Torres tried to lighten the mood. “Guess this means open-mic night’s canceled forever.”

Vik snorted — a single laugh. Then he froze. His eyes rolled back. His jaw locked, and he fell twitching into the firelight.

 Albert declares "He thought and he thought wrong, wrong answer." 

Everyone stared.

Albert whispered, “Told you. Un-funny.”

By dawn, the survivors were three.
Torres was hysterical, half-crazed from watching his brother die mid-chuckle.
Mia wouldn’t speak.
Gage kept repeating, “It’s in the air. It’s in the air.”

Albert knew better. It wasn’t airborne — it was in them.

The virus had evolved to detect laughter before it even surfaced — the micro-muscle flicker, the subconscious amusement before the sound escaped. Humor had become a death sentence.

He stood before the others and shouted, “Look around you! These dumb f%$!! laugh, they die! You see it now?”

Mia looked up, her face pale.
“They’re not laughing at anything anymore,” she whispered. “They’re laughing because something inside them wants to.”

Albert’s jaw tightened. “Then maybe humanity’s punchline finally came due.”

Page 7 — The Spoof

Later that day, while decoding a corrupted transmission, they picked up a recording — a mocking imitation of Albert’s voice.

“"He thought and he thought wrong, wrong answer."Un-funny!”
It looped, warped, distorted — someone had spliced it into a remix.
Torres thought it was a prank from the dead networks. He smirked.

That was enough.

He gasped mid-grin, blood vessels bursting in his eyes, laughter hacking out of him like broken glass.
Albert watched in silence as Torres choked to death on his own amusement.

Mia screamed. Gage puked. The radio kept playing the remix.

“Un-funny"He thought and he thought wrong, wrong answer."! Un-funny!”

Albert crushed the device under his boot.

Page 8 — The Realization

Only Albert and Mia survived long enough to reach the neural archives beneath the Pentagon ruins.
Inside, they discovered the truth: the Joke wasn’t man-made. It was evolutionary.
Humanity had encoded humor as a coping mechanism — a pressure valve for pain. But the virus hijacked that mechanism, turning laughter against itself.

Albert stood before the flickering servers, realization dawning.

“Mia,” he said quietly, “you know what’s funny?”

She looked up, terrified. “Don’t—”

He smiled for the first time in years.

“That this is how it ends. A species that joked itself to death.”

Mia tried to stop him, but it was too late — the smile spread, a dry, broken chuckle escaping from his throat.

The virus welcomed him home.
