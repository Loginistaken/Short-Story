Albert Madsen invented it because he feared accidents, loved patterns, and once watched three people nearly
die at the same intersection while arguing about whose turn it was. Mia, his longtime collaborator and reality-check, 
helped translate Albert’s dense math-brain logic into something ordinary people could live with. A year after its release, 
RSIS — the Road Safety Intelligence System — had quietly become part of everyday life. It came preinstalled on new phones as a mobile app, 
politely embedded in the latest model cars, and blinked reassuringly on dashboards and bike modules across the country.
RSIS wasn’t flashy or dramatic; it was simply a calm, intelligent presence that understood roads, weather, speed limits, 
and human hesitation. It didn’t scold drivers — it guided them verbally and or blinked. The verbal prompt recording would warn cyclist 
of a vehicle approaching from around 300 feet away, this system used a node agreement to user GPS through location on phone or car which was also a common device an easy install for all users as mobile app and cyclist which used Bluetooth 5 system that could run with or without internet conection at certian ranges up to multiple hundred of feet, as in inverse manner the driver would be forewarned to resume safe speed, this system served as a software to reduce accidents and it worked. 

One year in, the data arrived — and it was undeniable. Roadway fatalities were down. Not slightly. Drastically. 
Insurance companies were baffled. Statisticians rechecked their spreadsheets in disbelief. Cities began quietly adjusting
infrastructure based on RSIS feedback. Albert, meanwhile, sat alone in his kitchen at 3:14 a.m., staring at a piece of burnt toast,
thinking the same impossible thought over and over: he must have saved someone who was supposed to die.

Albert didn’t believe in fate. He believed in probability curves, feedback loops, and coffee strong enough to bend time. 
But something felt wrong. Logos looked different. A celebrity everyone remembered dying was very much alive. 
A city name on the news sounded mispronounced — or maybe always had been. Mia waved it off as the Mandela Effect. 
Brains misremember things. Patterns lie. But RSIS had shifted collision trees that used to end in funerals into awkward 
apologies and insurance claims. Entire branches of probability no longer terminated where they once did. Statistically, 
someone should be missing. But no one was. Which meant — mathematically — someone who would have died didn’t.

That was when Albert’s mind did what anxious minds do best: escalate. What if RSIS saved the wrong person? Not someone evil,
not a villain — just someone who would later make things worse. He imagined absurd scenarios: a man saved from hydroplaning
who later invented clapping at movie theaters; a woman spared a crash who went on to microwave fish at work; someone who 
once would’ve learned a hard lesson and now never returned shopping carts. He spiraled. Mia listened patiently, 
arms crossed, until she summarized his concern bluntly: he was afraid his system accidentally allowed jerks to continue existing.

When framed that way, even Albert had to laugh — briefly.

Digging deeper, Albert realized RSIS hadn’t erased outcomes — it redistributed them. Near-misses became lessons. 
Dangerous intersections got redesigned. Drivers arrived late and annoyed instead of dead. The world hadn’t fractured.
It had softened. The imagined “wrong person” didn’t become a catastrophe. They simply lived. And living meant they could still change.
RSIS wasn’t rewriting fate; it was buying time. He recalculated his prior presumed scenarios the clients he'd saved in those hypothetical 
outcomes he decided he loved humanity giving people a second chance was what he was there for, to save lives.

The real danger, Albert eventually understood, wasn’t who RSIS saved. It was complacency. A system too effective could lull humans 
into surrendering responsibility. Cities might treat it like magic instead of math. And the out come Albert decides how to upgrade non-users (those who didn't download RSIS Apps) or (drivers,pedestrians,cyclist without RSIS)  Drivers might forget and imagine everyone is a user, he made more rigid outlines for non-user accidents areas and enabled a non-user blue tooth awarness that made non-user node agreement so non-user could turn on Bluetooth Non-User Detection & Consent Flow (Platform-Safe)
sending from user to non-user Broadcasts BLE SPB packets by non-user enabling safety alerts.That was the future Albert needed to prevent before it arrived. So he updated RSIS — not louder, not stricter, just wiser. 



Albert didn’t fix the universe. He just kept it from tipping. Somewhere that night, a dashboard light blinked quietly
— no sound, no drama — and a life continued, slightly altered and slightly safer, unaware it had ever been almost a statistic. 
Mia raised a glass to boring outcomes. Albert smiled and toasted to everyone still being around to complain about them.
