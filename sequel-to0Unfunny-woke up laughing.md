Albert Madsen woke up laughing. Not the violent, body-breaking laughter from the dream — 
just a soft exhale, a half-smile slipping out of him like steam. His chest rose. His lungs worked.
His heart stayed put. Moonlight spilled through the curtains. Mia was beside him, warm, real,
breathing. Her arm rested across his stomach the way it always did when she slept deeply — 
like she was anchoring him to the mattress, to the world. Albert blinked. No ruins. No silence. 
No dead cities echoing with laughter. Just the quiet hum of the refrigerator and a distant car 
passing outside. He whispered, “Oh… thank God.”

Mia stirred. “You okay?” she mumbled.

“Yeah,” he said. “I think we just died saving humanity in my dream.”

She smiled saying "I'm glad you said we" without opening her eyes. “Do it again later. I’ve got a meeting at nine.”

Albert lay there, staring at the ceiling, heart still racing. He wanted to explain how in the dream the 
joke had been based on bananas he believed in his dream this could be a reality after the bat scare,
he giggles quitely as Mia tries to sleep. The dream clung to him — not like fear,although
afraid to laugh out loud tremendesouly.

It was 4:03 A.M., he gave up on sleep. Albert tip-toed into the kitchen, poured coffee hot,
and strong, the way you might when you’re afraid the idea might evaporate if you blink too long. 
He sat at his home PC, the familiar keyboard worn smooth beneath his fingers. Laughter as a involuntary neurological disease.
He typed it, then paused. He thought of the last few years — pandemics, isolation, 
the way fear moved faster than truth, the way ideas spread before facts could catch them.
He remembered watching the world laugh nervously through masks, through screens, through the 
slow realization how horrifying the repulse to laugh was and how he lost all his friends within the dream,
realized no body likes to hear about other people dreams but somehow the plot mangled him as he couldn't 
decpict from reality anymore how crazy things had been the several years of his life and everything, 
hell it felt real just because someone slipped on a banana the world collapsed,  
he thought deeply how to capture the dream on canvas 
man wasn't as invincible as jokes made them seem.

“What if,” he whispered, “the brain catches things too?” He laughed — a short, careful one. 
“It's a message,” he muttered, "a prophecy in a since, the script writer of the message had twisted sense of humor.”

He typed faster now. A joke so contagious it kills. A world where silence is survival. 
A comedian immune because he stopped laughing. Albert leaned back. “Yeah,” he said to no one. “That’ll get a room quiet.”

Mia appeared in the doorway, wrapped in a robe, hair wild, eyes sharp even half-awake. “You’re working again,” she said.

He nodded. “I think I was handed a premise.”

She crossed the room, read the screen, her expression tightening just a bit. “That dream still bothering you?”

“No,” Albert said. Then corrected himself. “Yes. But in a useful way.”

She kissed the top of his head. “Just promise me something.”

“What?”

“If you ever start believing it wasn’t just a dream,” she said, “you tell me.”

Albert smiled. “Deal.”

She went back to bed. The cursor blinked. Albert stared at it longer than necessary.
Somewhere deep inside him, something whispered: Dreams don’t usually come with instructions. 
He shook it off and typed the title anyway: -       UN-FUNNY.

Two weeks later, Albert was back on stage. A small club. Low ceiling. Sticky floors. 
The kind of room where laughter usually arrived early, comfortable, and arrogant — 
it assumed it would always be welcome. Mia sat near the back, arms folded, watching 
him like a scientist watching a familiar experiment rerun under slightly different conditions.

Albert adjusted the mic. “So,” he began, “before we get started… I should explain something.”

A pause.

“I have been givin a dream.”

The room shifted slightly. Faint, polite murmurs.

“Yes,” Albert said, raising one finger. “A proper nightmare. One of those where the
world ends — quietly, politely… with everyone laughing themselves to death.”

A faint chuckle passed through the room.

He nodded. “I know, it sounds absurd. But in the dream, I saved humanity.”

He let that hang.

“Not hero-style. Not guns or speeches or morality. I saved it because I stopped laughing.
I didn’t think it was funny anymore. Didn’t smile. Didn’t snort. Didn’t even twitch at punchlines.”

A small ripple of unease passed through the audience, unnoticed by anyone except him.

“I watched entire cities collapse under their own joy. Friends. Strangers. 
Your neighbor who always borrows sugar. Everyone. And then…” he leaned toward the mic, voice dropping, “I laughed. Once. And woke up.”

The silence thickened, pregnant with something no one could quite name.

“I know what you’re thinking,” Albert continued, calm, almost clinical. 
“How can laughter kill? How can comedy be lethal? How can I be here talking to you like none of this matters?”

He smiled thinly. “Because dreams don’t care if you understand them. They just happen.”

He paused, scanning the room like a man cataloging potential survivors.

“So if you think about it…” he said softly, almost conspiratorially, “I saved the world in my sleep. You’re welcome.”

A cough somewhere in the back. Polite laughter. Not much. Albert let it slide.

“But,” he said, voice darker now, “then I woke up. And realized the real horror.”

He paused again.

“I still had to go to work.”

A tiny laugh — short, brittle — slipped from his lips.

He straightened. “And here’s the kicker: the world didn’t know it was saved.
It kept doing the same stupid things, believing laughter was harmless, believing joy was safe.”

He shook his head slowly. “And that,” he whispered, “is what makes a nightmare last longer than a night.”

---

The show ended applause. People were content. The audience left the room, murmuring,
laughing quietly at their own nervous relief. The laughter had a strange weight to it, as if it had already done too much.

Albert stepped offstage. He felt lightheaded, not from performance, but because every word had grazed some truth he hadn’t intended to tell.

Backstage, Mia met him. Her gaze was sharp. “You explained it,” she said quietly. “Too well.”

He nodded. “I don’t think they understand… or maybe they do, and that’s worse.”

She didn’t argue. She just squeezed his hand once, letting him know she was there, 
and that he was still anchored to reality — fragile, but real.

Outside, the city carried on. People laughed at phones, at absurdities, at nothing at all.
Albert watched them, counting the beats. Not one person laughed incorrectly, yet somehow everything felt wrong.

---

That night, Albert lay awake beside Mia. He didn’t dream of death this time. Not exactly.

Instead, he dreamt in fragments. Laughter arriving before punchlines. Smiles that flickered
like faulty lights. People bending over, clutching chests, not sure why.

He wrote notes in the dark:

* Laughter can arrive too early.
* Laughter can linger too long.
* Laughter can forget it’s a joke.

He deleted each line after writing it. Too ominous. Too precise.

Eventually, he slept, one eye twitching, one hand hovering over the keyboard in case the dream needed instructions again.

---

Days later, an article appeared buried under trivial headlines: “Neurologists
Report Rare Cases of Involuntary Laughter Linked to Temporal Overload.”

Albert read it once. Then again. He didn’t laugh. He closed the tab.

Outside, a child giggled, unprompted. Someone else barked a laugh at a meme on a phone screen.
Another laughed in a traffic jam. Timing slightly off, but enough.

Albert watched the shadows move, heart steady, lungs working. He realized, quietly: The dream hadn’t ended. It had merely gone home. Waiting.
