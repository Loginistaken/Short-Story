Scrumdidlyumscious
A Prequel to Un-Funny*

Page 1 — The Birth of a Craving


It began like all disasters do — with a catchy jingle, in an ad.

Albert Madsen, PhD in Comedic Linguistics (a real degree he invented just to irritate serious people),
sat on his couch late one Friday night, halfway through a rerun of “What Happened and then what really happened.” 
He was in his prime then — hair wild, wit sharper than caffeine, a man who told jokes like equations 
and never once laughed at his own punchlines, half-watching late-night TV.                  
Then it came on: a jingle so catchy it practically tap-danced across his cerebral cortex.

Then the television screamed to life:

“🎵 Super-Scrumdidlyumscious Tasty Snack Treats! Party Puffs for Party People! 🎵”
A voice sped up like an auctioneer on caffeine:

“Warning: product contains the newly approved flavor enhancer ChimeriYum™, found safe by the FDA for

limited social consumption. Side effects may include increased charisma, compulsive snacking, and mild existential joy. Share responsibly!”

Albert blinked.
He didn’t catch half of that. But he did hear the words “mild existential joy.”
That sounded… delicious.

Albert blinked, caught only the sparkle of words like party, tasty, approved, and something about sharing with friends.

He missed the phrase mildly addictive.
He missed ChimeriYum.

Instead, he just thought:

“Damn, that’s good copywriting.” —

The next day, he stopped at a gas station for caffeine and petro.

There, by the register, sat the bag: Super-Scrumdidlyumscious Party Puffs — Season Burst Edition.
A holographic label glowed “Now With Chimeriyum™!” like divine certification.

Albert grabbed a bag, then another — one for science.

The clerk, a curvy woman with an overworked smile and crumbs on her chin, rang him up. 

Her name tag read Cheryl — Ask Me About Chimeriyum.

Albert grinned.
“Alright, Cheryl, I’ll bite. What’s Chimeriyum?”

She chewed thoughtfully on her own puff.
“No idea,” she said between crunches. “But I can’t stop eating these.”

He left with three bags and the faint suspicion that civilization had peaked.

Albert chuckled. “Marketing’s getting smarter,” he muttered, buying three bags and a diet soda for irony.

At home, he cracked the bag open — a pssshh like divine carbonation. The scent hit him: buttery, salty, 

faintly chemical — like childhood (reminded of his first candy bar)  with a strange since of regret mixed together.

The first puff melted on his tongue.
The second disappeared before he realized he’d eaten it.
By the third, he was having what philosophers might call a religious experience, if religion came in corn-based form.

He thought: Damn, that’s scrumdidlyumscious.

That night, during his live comedy set at The Velvet Joke, Albert worked the new material.

“You ever eat something so good you start negotiating with Morality? Like, ‘Okay, one more bag and I’ll stop believing in free will.’”

The audience roared.
Albert didn’t laugh — he never did. He stood there, a surgeon of irony, scalpel-sharp.

laughter was for the amateurs.

Backstage, Mia waited — his ex, a neuroscientist with sharp eyes and zero tolerance for bullshit. She handed him a half-eaten candy bar.

“Guess the FDA calls this food now,” she said.

He looked at the wrapper — Super-Scrumdidlyumscious Nougat Bliss, with Chimeriyum™.

“You too?” he asked.

She shrugged. “For research. Also, it’s delicious.”

He smirked. “Those are my two favorite reasons for self-destruction.”

Page 4 — Mia’s Warning

Later, in her apartment littered with empty bags, Mia pulled up a data chart.

“Chimeriyum,” she said, “is a synthetic serotonin analog fused with a flavor compound. 

It doesn’t just taste good — it teaches your brain what ‘good’ means.”

Albert leaned over the screen. “So it’s pharmaceutical level drug which is new and un-regulated not declared a substance yet”

“It’s a personality hijacker,” she said. “A bite-sized serotonin addiction.”

He laughed once — dryly.
“Happiness is cheaper in bulk.”

She frowned. “You’re not taking this seriously.”

 Mia's friend Larry calls he's a mutuail friend of Albert and Mia so Mia puts him on speaker phone 

 Larry They all greet each other on speakerphone — Larry starts to explain.

“I can’t get…” he mumbles, and there’s a crinkle of a bag, a loud crunch, and the sound of chewing right into the mic.

Albert interupts you're ah chewing into the microphone. Then Larry says

“I...I can’t get off the couch,” .He adds "Have you seen the news?" "It's all over the palce like a plague, 

fat men have flipped over like beetles, helpless on their backs —" but with the adiction Larry adds you want to socialize" 

Albert remembers being drawn to gas clerk how he wanted to share nibbles and do soical bags. Albert Snaps out of it Mia adds 

she'd been eating soacailly larry interupts. He said its the jinngle its caught in his head and he wants them to come over and do 

some socail grinding? but then he confesses, read the news first."

And sure enough Albert and Mia turn on the news they'd been avoidong recently and like Larry says 

its an epidimc obesity is out like wild-fire victims of something so irresistibly tasty that one bite always demands another.

The TV broadcast the news channel as the hosts interviews a near casulaity. they sound like they remain semi-unaware of whats really 

going on like the rest, as the interviewed replied

"There must be some addictive ingredient baked into it." then the camera-man shoots vootage of a street corner the homeless 

topled amognst there other prior aadictions now the even the zombies are fat and more non-drug addicts lay obese asking for another bite.

The TV hosts goes on "compulsive behavior, hunger that’s not hunger.”

Albert shrugged. “It’s called flavor, Mia. Civilization runs on it.”

She stared at him. “Civilizations fall on it too.”

Page 5 — The Beautiful Clerk

Albert ignored her. The next morning, he went back for more.

The clerk — a younger woman sat behind the clerk counter this time  with an overconfident smile 

and underconfident posture — was munching a Super-Scrumdidlyumscious Candy Bar.

“Good, huh?” Albert asked.

She nodded, mouth full. “They’re like… edible serotonin.”

Albert bought two. Then he noticed her nametag: Layla

Within weeks, the commercials multiplied.
Super-Scrumdidlyumscious sponsored everything — talk shows, stand-up specials, even public service announcements.

Their slogan changed:

“Don’t just eat. Belong.”

New flavors dropped weekly — BlueberryBunaglo, Cinnamon hangover, Lite-bittersweet-Heavy, Roswell Nacho.

Stores ran out within hours. People were scalping bags online.

Albert joked onstage:

“They say it’s not addictive — it’s just emotionally persuasive. Like dating an influencer with abs.”

The audience howled. He didn’t laugh.

Page 7 — The Experiment

Mia started running tests.

“Chimeriyum,” she explained one night, “is a hybrid compound of serotonin mimetics and flavor amplifiers. 

It bonds to neural receptors that regulate satisfaction.”

Albert raised an eyebrow. “You mean… happiness?”

“I mean you could replace sex, laughter, or religion with it,” she said flatly.

He popped a puff in his mouth. “Why choose?”

Page 8 — The Slow Bloat

People were changing.

Comedians stopped writing. Artists stopped painting. Everyone started hosting Snack Parties — 

entire weekends spent binging Super-Scrumdidlyumscious and posting euphoric selfies.

The term Snackism appeared in journals — a pseudo-spiritual lifestyle about finding bliss through consumption.

Albert gained twelve pounds and a new bit:

“They call it ‘Lite.’ Yeah, that’s what my self-respect says every morning: ‘I’m feeling kinda lite today.’”

The crowd erupted.
Half of them were eating during the show.

Static. Crunching. Then silence.

Albert set down his candy bar. For the first time, the aftertaste felt wrong — too perfect.
He looked at Mia. Her eyes were wide, pupils dilated, a blissful glaze over them.

On the TV, a new ad played.

“Super-Scrumdidlyumscious — now with extra ChimeriYum! Because one craving is never enough.”

Page 9 — Epilogue: The Punchline

Albert sat on the couch, surrounded by wrappers.
The laughter track from the ad echoed softly.

He muttered to himself:

“Maybe this is how comedy ends. Not with a joke… but a snack.”

He reached for one last puff.

It melted like laughter on his tongue.
