Title: “Un-Funny laugh and you're out”
A Dystopian 

Page 1 — The First Laugh, they said it started at a dark and errie insane asylum.

It was cusp normal somewhere round 2018, back when you still double glanced at the person in public wearing a KN95 face mask and
before some had ever valued true commodities like tollet paper. Worsening economies in the city lead to more
homless population. As some recently had found themselves on the streets
they where spirtually lost and made new friends amongest the fellow unsheltered, on the cluttered sidewalks and alleyways 
an epidemic is emerging an uncontrollable hysteria. Amongst the homless you hear a repulsive laughter that cries out 
day and night, the mayor in hostility begins an effort to clean up the cities outskirts, the heart of the commotion. The subjects were caught red handed showing signs of insanity and noise disturbance the majority carried to paddy wagon and taken to mental institution so they could anaylize the sistuation. Of course no one knows the exact origin, or the intial carrier even what the joke was but there were some key clues. The yuppies had new classy titles for this generation of homeless, as two men in suits ties and trench coats had gone for lunch off their normal route they strolled the streets walking side by side, non-treaded standard buisness shoes slaps pavement one of the gentlemen
murmured "but hey, at least they're  participants in the synthetic economy",
the other glanced at the streets inhabitants, then replies back to colleague “devotees of modern chemistry” a tent dweller overherd the conversation as the two men in suits and ties passed and roars out hysterically, in disbielf one wispers (as the laughter is beoming more evident of a symptom) "At least his agony wasn't irritable". Recent reports showed increase in epidemiological data indicate that even microgram-level exposures, often occurring unintentionally through adulterated pharmaceuticals or recreational substances, significantly increase acute respiratory depression risk, a Docotor inside insitution taunts a grinning patient whom repeadily back talked the Doctor, "Let's sober up" the newbie smiles harder the Doc adds "Well no more street life substance for you as he straps the patient into a padded timeout vest calling take him away, no more sudden out burts!" as the large male nurse carries him away the deranged subject whales out a crying helpless laughter as he tries to break free of being detained.Although there were other patients amognst the voices that cried out on the street at night other patients seeked refuge from the homeless and their addictions others forced to live there. The asylum was a spooky castle
stone and dark from age with moss and rusted steel beams, was elevated into the moonlight and drew the clouds to its castle peak.
The first arrivals were ragged, hollow-eyed, but with sparks of something unhinged in their gaze. 
The streets had chewed them up and spat them out, leaving nervous energy, twitching limbs, and a nervous mania for 
anything that could bring relief — medications, anything they could get their hands on, even the faintest whiff of a joke.

Some sought sanctuary in the asylum, drawn less by medicine than by the promise of controlled chaos. Within those peeling walls, laughter became a language of survival. It rang off the cracked tiles and rusted iron bars,
sometimes rising spontaneously, sometimes as a symptom of a delirium induced by withdrawal.
Night after night, the echoes of madmen’s chuckles intertwined with moans, mutterings, and the occasional scream — a grotesque symphony orchestrated by the desperate and the deranged.

The joke — whatever it had been on the streets — transformed inside. It became a virus of the mind, accelerated by desperation and chemical imbalance. One man laughed at shadows as he sees faces in the tattered walls the lady with the medication cart startles the laughing man  (he hushes maybe it was her back bent over the cart as if she was deformed in the shadows) the laugh drew suddenly silent the sound the wheels on the cart could be herd as it approached, he thinks he hears the lady with the medication cart wisper in tounges to someone sleeping as they respond the laughing man begins to laugh again another wept at silence, and yet another performed entire pantomimes of invisible conversations. 

Staff whispered about micrograms, exposure, and poly-drug toxicity — but the real epidemic was human chaos, and no clipboard could measure it.

Even the Doctor at the assylum the main psychoanalyst smirked and irked his will to giggle he began to convulse.
Anyone who laughed — even chuckled — caught the “Joke.”

At first, it was harmless. People couldn’t stop laughing. The streets filled with hysterical sounds — uncontrollable, animal-like laughter echoing through subways and hospitals. Then, the laughter turned violent. The muscles convulsed, lungs collapsed, brains hemorrhaged. The virus wasn’t biological. It was neurological.
It spread through humor.

Page 2 —Meet Albert

Albert Madsen didn’t find much funny these days.
He used have his P.H.D in comedy, focused as a writer — the kind of man who once made crowds roar on late-night TV. But he quit after the Incident. Now he worked as a behavioral linguist for the Federal NeuroDefense Corps — or what was left of it. His job: decode cognitive infections, linguistic pathogens, and “idea viruses.”
He was a specialist in memetic toxicity — weaponized thoughts.

So when the Joke spread, Albert was one of the few people immune. Not because he was special, 
but because his sense of humor was jaded and too keen.

Page 3 — The Dying City

The streets of his home city in shambles, gone silent now except for the occasional shrill cackle of a at random laugh a bumb must have read the graffiti and vented aloud in disbelief something had crossed his mind, Albert woundered what on Earth the crackle could have been as response to, Albert knew the urge to investigate things would be the end of him. In the beginning he used his intuition to converse the intial contagion at point zero, with Mia his girlfriend at the time, they had stayed away from the news long enough to see ground zero the epicenter and the broadcaster did a professonal job keeping it serious as they prounced the Doctor of the notourious instiution deceased no one thought  it was one funny by this piont, but now the virus was mutating it seemed if anyone laughed at anything they died. As a comedian Albert hated how it killed the urge that tickled him to want chime in, so he kept a straight face and did so anyway, "I hated the recording of the asylums crackles" Mia gasps her since of humor wasn't dead she could only but sympathize, thats how Albert and Mia learned of how serious this neural virus was cause so many casulities drifting from what sounded from the side walk's diection (where Albert was) to the area near an abandoned building.
Graffiti read:
"Don't Go Bananas!"
“LAUGH OR DIE.”
“HAPPINESS IS CONTAGIOUS.”

Albert and his team — four soldiers and one data analyst named Mia — moved through the wreckage with respirators and neural filters. The devices scrambled auditory signals, preventing the virus from hijacking the brain’s humor centers.

They passed a group of bodies — mouths stretched wide, frozen in rigor-mortis laughter.

Albert muttered, “Un-funny.”

Mia glanced at him. “You always say that.”

“That’s because it always is.”

Page 4 — The Comrades

Mia was bright — too bright, Albert thought — still hopeful, still cracking dry jokes to survive the tension.
Gage, the squad leader, was military through and through — believed fear was weakness, believed laughter was death.
Torres and Vik, the twins, once DJs, now technicians who treated silence like religion.
And Albert, their reluctant prophet of irony, a man allergic to joy in a world where joy killed.

They were searching for the origin post — the first file uploaded before the networks crashed. Somewhere deep in the ruins, that meme still looped, endlessly broadcasting the Joke.

Page 5 — The Mutation

By the time they found the signal source — an old broadcast hub — the virus had changed.
No longer just sound.
Now it spread through irony, sarcasm, and intent.

Someone said something funny — even accidentally — and the virus triggered. It detected comedic structure, rhythm, or timing, then unleashed neural overload.

That night, around the campfire, Torres tried to lighten the mood. “Guess this means open-mic night’s canceled forever.”

Vik snorted — a single laugh. Then he froze. His eyes rolled back. His jaw locked, and he fell twitching into the firelight.

 Albert declares "He thought and he thought wrong, wrong answer." 

Everyone stared.

Albert whispered, “Told you. Un-funny.”

Page 6 — “They Laugh, They Die”

By dawn, the survivors were three.
Torres was hysterical, half-crazed from watching his brother die mid-chuckle.
Mia wouldn’t speak.
Gage kept repeating, “It’s in the air. It’s in the air.”

Albert knew better. It wasn’t airborne — it was in them.

The virus had evolved to detect laughter before it even surfaced — the micro-muscle flicker, the subconscious amusement before the sound escaped. Humor had become a death sentence.

He stood before the others and shouted, “Look around you! These dumb f%$!! laugh, they die! You see it now?”

Mia looked up, her face pale.
“They’re not laughing at anything anymore,” she whispered. “They’re laughing because something inside them wants to.”

Albert’s jaw tightened. “Then maybe humanity’s punchline finally came due.”

Page 7 — The Spoof

Later that day, while decoding a corrupted transmission, they picked up a recording — a mocking imitation of Albert’s voice.

“"He thought and he thought wrong, wrong answer."Un-funny!”
It looped, warped, distorted — someone had spliced it into a remix.
Torres thought it was a prank from the dead networks. He smirked.

That was enough.

He gasped mid-grin, blood vessels bursting in his eyes, laughter hacking out of him like broken glass.
Albert watched in silence as Torres choked to death on his own amusement.

Mia screamed. Gage puked. The radio kept playing the remix.

“Un-funny"He thought and he thought wrong, wrong answer."! Un-funny!”

Albert crushed the device under his boot.

Page 8 — The Realization

Only Albert and Mia survived long enough to reach the neural archives beneath the Pentagon ruins.
Inside, they discovered the truth: the Joke wasn’t man-made. It was evolutionary.
Humanity had encoded humor as a coping mechanism — a pressure valve for pain. But the virus hijacked that mechanism, turning laughter against itself.

Albert stood before the flickering servers, realization dawning.

“Mia,” he said quietly, “you know what’s funny?”

She looked up, terrified. “Don’t—”

He smiled for the first time in years.

“That this is how it ends. A species that joked itself to death.”

Mia tried to stop him, but it was too late — the smile spread, a dry, broken chuckle escaping from his throat.

The virus welcomed him home.
